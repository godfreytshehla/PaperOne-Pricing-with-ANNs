# Pricing Capital Guaranteed Structured Products with Feed-Forward Neural Networks

This repository contains Python code for pricing capital guaranteed structured products using feed-forward neural networks. Capital guaranteed structured products are financial instruments that offer investors protection on their principal investment while providing exposure to the potential upside of an underlying asset. This project demonstrates how to leverage neural networks for accurate and efficient pricing of these products.
